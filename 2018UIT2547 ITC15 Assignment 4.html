<ol type = "a">
  <li><b>Data Science Internship - Ericsson (July 2020 - September 2020):</b>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp &nbsp  Aim of the project is to detect anomaly in time series data. Temperatures of equipment from several cellphone tower sites are collected at an interval of two hours. The data collected is analyzed, &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp  the null values are filled with suitable values and exploratory data analysis is done to identify the trend in the data. The data for each site is fed separately to a machine learning model (regression &nbsp &nbsp   model), which then predicts the temperature for the particular site over the next 5 days and flags any abnormality that might occur over the period of time. This help prevents equipment damage &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp as the system can warn for a potential overheating.</p>
