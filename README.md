# Predicting Survival of people in Titanic

The aim of project was to predict the people who survived in the titanic. A dataset consisting of details of the passengers was divided into Training and Test dataset. Machine learning models were build using training dataset. Trained models were then used to see how well the model performs on unseen data. 
To start with, data exploration was done to check missing data and for identification of important features. Seaborn and matplotlib were used for visualizations. During data preprocessing part, we computed missing values, converted features into numeric ones, grouped values into categories and created few new features. 
Applied 6 different machine learning models namely Stochastic Gradient Descent, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree to see which algorithm gives the best prediction and we further trained the model that gave the best prediction
